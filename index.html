<h2>Purpose and Scope of this Page</h2>
<p>
The primary intent of this page (at least as it currently stands) is to provide pointers to a 
other online outlets of notable relevance to my activity. Major, stable web addresses that
list non-trivial subsets of my materials can be found on <a href="#myORCIDiDInfo">my above-mentioned ORCID page</a>;
those websites will not be re-listed here in order to minimize repetition and maintain organization.
Other <em>pointers to content</em> that stand alone or would otherwise crowd <a href="#myORCIDiDInfo">my ORCID page</a> are
listed here - they will be referred to as <a href="#additionalMaterials">"additional materials"</a>. References
to <em>additional accounts</em> belonging to me that <em>lack substantive content</em>
can be found in the section 
<a href="#publicallyVisibleAccountsOfLittleRelavence">"publicly visible online accounts of little relevance"</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do not claim that the collection of materials referenced 
here is complete or comprehensive. In fact, I suspect that online content which is highly unstable will
not be referenced here, at least not frequently. Further, the focus of this page is to list material that
is already publicly accessible, and thus, links to content intended for a limited audience will not
be provided.
</p>

	<p>
	As the title suggests, the links in this section offer little noteworthy to visit. At the time being, 
        I have no intention of changing that fact. The accounts listed here exist for a variety of reasons,
	such as to allow interested parties to more easily locate me (me - as opposed to someone else with a
	similar name) online. Here, I refrain from expounding the rationales beyond that.

				<li>
					This account only presents my name, reference to 
					<a href="#myORCIDiDInfo">my ORCID identifier</a>,
					and a vague reference to my Carnegie Mellon University education
					(which is already listed on ORCID).
