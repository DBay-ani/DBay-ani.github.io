<h2>Purpose and Scope of this Page</h2>
<p>
The primary intent of this page (at least as it currently stands) is to provide pointers to a 
other online outlets of notable relevance to my activity. Major, stable web addresses that
list non-trivial subsets of my materials can be found on <a href="#myORCIDiDInfo">my above-mentioned ORCID page</a>;
those websites will not be re-listed here in order to minimize repetition and maintain organization.
Other items that stand alone or would otherwise crowd <a href="#myORCIDiDInfo">my ORCID page</a> are
listed here - they will be referred to as <a href="#additionalMaterials">"additional materials"</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do not claim that the collection of materials referenced 
here is complete or comprehensive. In fact, I suspect that online content which is highly unstable will
not be referenced here, at least not frequently. Further, the focus of this page is to list material that
is already publicly accessible, and thus links to content intended for a limited audience will not
be provided.
